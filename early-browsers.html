        <h2>Early Browsers</h2>
        <p>The history of web browsers began in the early 1990s with the creation of the World Wide Web. The first browsers were simple tools for accessing text-based web pages.</p>
        <p>Tim Berners-Lee is credited for developing that first ever browser known as the World Wide Web or WWW, and it was renamed Nexus in later years. In the beginning of it's creation,
            there wasn't a search engine associated with the browser. The search capabilities were strictly relying on keywords. By 1993, Mosaic was created by the National Centre 
            for Supercomputing Applications and it quickly gained popularity for being the first graphical browser to demonstrate images on the web. Shortly after, Netscape became famous
            for being the first to go public, and by 1995 Microsoft released the Internet Explorer, which later became known as Microsoft Edge.</p>
        <p>Following this trend, we later gained access to browsers like Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Google Chrome. With the advancements of new browsers 
            came new features and rendering was able to be completed at high speeds. As technology continued to evolve, each company tried to outdo the others, and browser war ensued.</p>
        <h3>Evolution of Web Browser Technology</h3>
        <p>Web browsers have certainly evolved over the years and continue to modernize in new ways today. Browser preferences have become increasingly important with expectations of meeting a rapidly growing and complex new internet. Browsers like Mosaic and Netscape have laid the foundation for features that have become standard today. We’ve grown substantially from text-based systems and place focus on an interactive, user-driven experience. </p>
        <p>With Firefox being released in 2004, they quickly began to gain popularity for its focus on adhering to web standards. Users were seeking a faster, more secure,and open-source option. Firefox was able to fulfill that by providing a customizable user interface with unique security features</p>
        <p>In 2008, Google Chrome surpassed competitors with its speed and minimalist designs that gave users a clean and overall seamless experience. The utilization of a V8 JavaScript engine changed the game as improved web page loading times set a whole new performance standard. </p>
        <p>The continuation of such innovative features changed the direction of web browsers and the desire for such measures only continues to push boundaries. </p>
